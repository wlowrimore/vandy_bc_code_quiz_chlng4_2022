It features a clean, polished and responsive user interface (UI). With each incorrect answer, 10 seconds are deducted from your timer and overall score. When the timer reaches 0, the quiz is over.

A link is provided to reveal the high scores that are located in your local storage. When you are ready to clear the high score list, just click the "Clear Highscores" button, and the stored data will be removed.
